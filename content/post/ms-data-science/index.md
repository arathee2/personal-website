Data science is a vast field. No master's program can cover all of it. This is why data science professionals choose their niche (business analytics, NLP, deep learning, etc.) and specialize in it. After working in data science field for three years, I have chosen my niche: machine learning (ML). Mastering ML was one of the biggest motivations why I applied to graduate school. It is one thing to apply ML algorithms using existing libraries (such as scikit-learn and PyTorch), but it's a different thing altogether to use them appropriately which requires understanding the inner workings of an algorithm, understand its advantages and disadvantages, and to learn the scenarios where it should and should not be used. To fulfil my goal of specializing in ML, I have created a list of topics that I think will enable me to have a successfull career in data science and ML. My goal is to learn all foundational maths and computer science courses that from this list by the time I graduate in May 2021. The source of learning these topics will university courses, online courses, and books. The list of topics is present below along with an emoji showcasing my current progress. I will be constantly this post to accomodate new topics and to update my progress.

Note on emoji reference:
- :heavy_check_mark:: Completed learning the topic and feel fairly confident in it. 
- :x:: Yet to start.
- :clock2:: Work-in-progress.
